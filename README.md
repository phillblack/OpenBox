# OpenBox
This project is for beginners only, but experts are welcome to make comments. The point of this project is to provide beginners to Game developement a collaborative environment where they can learn the basics and practice.

Hello World!
  Ok so maybe that's a cheesy way to start off this project, but hey, it works. 
  
  Welcome to the OpenBox! Hopefully I'll be able to explain everything you'll need to know to get started on the OpenBox project. Simply put - if you have an interest in Game development (art, music, programming, design) but don't know where to get started, then this is the place to be. As the project grows, we'll gain more learners and experts, but as of right now (24th August 2016) it's just me: Ian Miller
  
  A bit about myself 
I am a computer science major at the Ohio State University. I've been making computer games as a hobby ever since my hands could touch a keyboard (well maybe a little less than that). Currently I do programming for Games as a freelancer largely in Unity, but I've dealt with other engines such as UE4 and Cryengine. I've taught Game design, programming, and computers in general to all kinds of people, so don't feel like you can't learn from this project. It's very possible once you know how to go about it!

I will do my best to help guide and instruct anyone who joins the project, but I may not have time for everyone, nor can I help with everything (directly). Maybe I'll even learn something with you! 
    
  A bit about yourself  
A discussion board will be set up soon to help facilitate communication, so until then just think about cool game ideas and things you'd love to learn! I invite anyone of any age, of any interest, of any discipline to keep their eyes on this project. 
    
  A bit about the Game 
The point of this project is that we create a game of our own original ideas from start to finish. As such, nothing about this game has been planned out, and instead, will be the first subject of discussion for this project.
    
 Once a good number of the community commit and interest to this project, we can start the difficult stage known as PRE-production. This is the set in developement where you come up with your ideas, and define what kind of experience you hope to create. This is generally very details, but VERY subject to change. Sometimes prototypes are built, sometimes you just go ahead and commit a whole team to a project once it leaves preproduction, but we'll see how we do. This is often an important stage in developement that beginners don't get access to, so I wanted to provide the opportunity to at least the early members of this project.
